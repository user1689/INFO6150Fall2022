          tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when

          but not in my bed purr when being pet disappear for four days 
          and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet if it 
          fits i sits hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away 
          for fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) yet litter 
          box is life.
