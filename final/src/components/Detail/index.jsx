                        Temperament Seemingly always in motion, she’ll slow down
                        occasionally to curl up next to you on the couch or in
                        bed. Although independent, she does best with another
                        Aby companion to match her high activity levels while
                        you’re away. Abyssinians love attention from you and
                        respectful children and get along well with cat-friendly
                        dogs, as well as other pets, like large parrots and
                        ferrets. Characteristics The Abyssinian has a
                        wedge-shaped, yet rounded head with broad ears and
                        almond-shaped eyes in shades of gold or green. Her body
                        is muscular and athletic, but slim, and supported by
                        fine-boned legs. Lifespan 9 to 15 years Colors
                        Abyssinians have what is known as a “ticked” coat, which
                        alternates light and dark bands of color on each hair
                        shaft. The warmth glow of their coat resembles wild cats
                        like cougars. The coat comes in four primary colors:
                        ruddy brown, red, blue and fawn. Some associations
                        permit additional colors, however. Shedding Weekly
                        grooming is sufficient to maintain your Aby’s coat, but
                        you may need more frequent brushing and bathing during
                        shedding seasons to remove the loose hair faster.

                        Temperament Despite their somewhat wild appearance,
                        American Bobtails are devoted companion cats who fit
                        perfectly into families. Social and easygoing, they get
                        along well with children and other four-legged pets.
                        Confident and friendly, Bobtails are highly intelligent
                        pets with dog-like personalities. They love games like
                        fetch and hide-and-seek, and even enjoy walking on a
                        leash with their people. Characteristics The American
                        Bobtail bears a distinct resemblance to a bobtailed
                        wildcat. From her markings and alert, hunter’s gaze to
                        her short, expressive tail, her appearance suggests a
                        scaled-down version of that wild cat. Lifespan 13 to 15
                        years Colors The American Bobtail’s coat can come in any
                        pattern, including black, brown, chocolate, cinnamon,
                        blue, lilac, fawn, red and cream, with or without white.
                        Shedding The American Bobtail is a moderate shedding
                        breed. Whether medium or long, her coat requires
                        brushing only a couple of times a week to remove loose
                        hair.

                        Temperament As they age, British Shorthairs become
                        increasingly sedentary, however males are often more
                        rambunctious than the reserved females. They get along
                        well with gentle and respectful children and don’t mind
                        cat-friendly dogs. Characteristics British Shorthairs
                        are round all over, with a broad chest and strong legs.
                        Their coats are short, thick and plush. Eye color
                        depends on coat color, but you can expect British Blues
                        to have gold eyes and those with point coloring to have
                        blue eyes. Other eye colors range from golden to copper.
                        Lifespan 12 to 17 years Colors Although their coats come
                        in almost every possible color and pattern, the most
                        popular color is blue (gray). These cats are sometimes
                        referred to as British Blues. Shedding Your British
                        Shorthair may experience seasonal shedding in the spring
                        and fall, so brush regularly during those periods to
                        remove loose hair. Outside of those seasons, weekly
                        brushing will suffice.

                        snuggle next to you in bed. Guests will be surprised by
                        her outgoing, dog-like nature. Characteristics Their
                        compact body is solid and muscular with a rounded head

                        sable, a solid, dark brown color. Newer lines of Burmese
                        come in several other shades, including blue, champagne
                        and platinum, and some associations even permit
                        tortoiseshell, lilac and red to be shown. Sable kittens’
                        coats darken as they mature and all colors have green or
                        golden eyes, depending on their coat color. Shedding
                        Shedding is minimal and weekly brushing will keep your
                        Burmese cat’s coat healthy and shiny by removing loose
                        hair and redistributing skin oils.

                        the cats were selectively bred to have quiet voices so

                        Temperament The Birman’s sweet and gentle nature makes
                        her an ideal companion and pet. Birmans are playful and
                        love to be with people, and are also patient and social
                        with children and other pets. While Birmans tend to be
                        fairly quiet, they will “talk” with soft, chirping
                        voices. They enjoy attention, and want to be where their
                        people are, helping with whatever activity is happening.
                        Characteristics This healthy, long-lived breed has an
                        outstanding, semi-long silky coat and a luxurious, long
                        bottle-brush tail. Brilliant blue, almost-round eyes are

                        and are not prone to matting, so they require only
                        weekly grooming with a stainless steel comb to keep
                        shedding under control.

                        Temperament Bombays are smart and learn tricks quickly,
                        so keep them entertained by teaching them new tricks and
                        providing them interactive toys to play with. Lifespan
                        12 to 16 years Colors Bombays have a dramatic and deep
                        black coat. The black coat is dominant, but occasionally
                        a litter produces a sable-colored kitten, and some
                        associations permit these kittens to be registered as
                        Burmese. Bombay eye color ranges from gold to copper.
                        Characteristics Aside from her black coat, the Bombay
                        resembles the Burmese. She has a larger and longer body,
                        however, and longer legs. Her rounded head is topped
                        with straight, wide-set, medium-sized ears and she has a
                        medium-length tail. History Nikki Horner, a breeder from
                        Louisville, KY, began developing the breed in the 1950s
                        by crossing a sable Burmese with a black American
                        Shorthair. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) recognized
                        the Bombay in 1978 and it’s recognized by all cat
                        associations today. Although outcrossing to black
                        American Shorthairs and sable Burmese is still
                        permitted, it’s done infrequently due to the breeds’
                        differences in body type. Facts The Bombay was bred to
                        resemble the black leopard found in India. Horner named
                        the breed for the exotic port city where this wild
                        feline is found. Many Bombays are entirely black,
                        including their paw pads, which isn’t a common trait in
                        other black cats. Shedding The tight-knit coat of Bombay
                        cats means they shed very little. Regular petting and
                        semi-weekly brushing removes loose hair and maintains
                        the coat’s shine.

                        Temperament They may come when called and can even learn
                        to play fetch. This sweet but playful feline prefers to
                        remain on the same level as her people, rather than
                        perched atop a bookcase or shelf. She’s good with
                        children, other cats and dogs. Characteristics Ragdolls
                        are one of the largest domestic cat breeds. They have a
                        large head in a softer wedge shape than the sharp
                        angular face of the Siamese. With a long, soft coat,
                        oval-shaped blue eyes and medium-sized ears with rounded
                        tips, their appearance matches their docile personality.
                        They have a solid neck with a large and long, yet solid
                        body, supported by a sturdy bone structure. Lifespan 12
                        to 17 Colors With point coloring similar to the
                        Himalayan or Siamese breed, Ragdolls have light-colored
                        bodies with darker extremities. With a color palette
                        ranging from seal to blue to chocolate to cinnamon and
                        more, the combinations of colors and patterns are almost
                        endless. Ragdolls also have distinct blue eyes. Shedding
                        Because Ragdoll Cats have little undercoat, they shed
                        moderately throughout the year and more heavily in
                        spring and fall. This also means less matting, but
                        regular brushing is still necessary to keep the coat
                        smooth, soft and free of tangles, mats and dead hair. If
                        you’re gentle, your Ragdoll will adore the attention
                        during grooming.
